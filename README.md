# SimplyMakeup
This project was made for StarterHacks 2019 with team members of: Cengiz Sirlan, Aaron Szucs, Brian Chan, Daniel Lee and Johnny Hoang.
The project is desgined to be an app that will take a picture of your face and figure out the average RGB value of the user's skin tone and
recommend them a list of foundations that suit the users complexion.

# How we built it
SimplyMakeup is built in the Unity Engine and is coded in C#. In doing so we implemented the Google Vision API and were able to take advantage of the facial recognition feature. When we merged the camera with Google Vision, we were able to find face(s) on the image and take their skin tone information in RGB format. This lead us to code an algorithm that takes the RGB value and sorts the foundation database to best match with the user's skin tone. Our Designers use Sketch and Powerpoint to craft the perfect vision and theme for our mobile application. This allowed our business teammates to pitch and covey SimplyMakeup at a 100%.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into various amounts of challenges throughout all stages of making this project. During the beginning stages we had to do a lot of industry and market research because none of us have any experience within this field. On top of story-boarding how the coding will work, we also needed to know the mechanics and problems the makeup industry faces and why there is a market. While developing this product, we had huge difficulty implementing the Google Vision API as we tried to make it compatible inside the Unity environment. In the late stages, we had troubles condensing our pitch to fit within the 3 minute mark and polishing it so that the most important points would stand out.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of finding such a niche market that is out of our expertise and turning it into a profitable product. Though it took us hours, we were able to successfully get the Google Vision API to work, and through rough work, figure out the needed libraries and functionalities from the API to work towards our advantage. For SimplyMakeup, minimalism and simplicity is key; our designs are able to successfully show this theme and give users a pleasing yet sophisticated experience.

# What we learned
We learnt a great deal in learning how to use external software such as APIs to further our project. Our team overall also dealt with a new coding language being C#. Being able to be adaptable to unfamiliar situations allowed our team to learn a great deal from these experiences. We had to learn to cooperate better, but also work independently in our delegated tasks.

# What's next for SimplyMakeup
In the future, we want to expand the apps functionalities, especially during the purchase of the product. Specifically, we want to allow users to purchase the foundation on our platform because we wish to open a new avenue for revenue and increase our customer base. We also want to expand the products that we can help users find such as lipsticks, concealer and massacre. As a long term goal, we wish to increase our partnerships with cosmetic companies to advertise on our platform while also providing exclusive coupons and deals to distribute as an incentive to build customer loyalty.
